# How it works

At the beginning of the game, the user provides an initial state of the grid.

The cells then evolve according to the following rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

From these rules, patterns emerge, creating fascinating behaviors like stable structures, oscillators, and gliders that move across the grid.
